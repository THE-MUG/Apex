This is an intermediate level SOQL Query I was asked to write.

1.  Retrieve Name, Department and Title of all Contacts.
2.  Retrieve all Cases [CaseNumber, Subject] raised by the contact.
3.  Get parent Account's Name and Rating for each contact.
4.  Position account fields to be the first result.
5.  Retrieve only those records where Account Rating is 'Hot'.
6.  Sort results by Contact Name.
7.  Only retrieve open cases.
8.  Contact Department must equal 'technology'.

SELECT Account.Name, Account.Rating, Name, Department, Title, 
(SELECT CaseNumber, Subject FROM Cases WHERE IsClosed = false) 
FROM Contact WHERE Account.Rating = 'Hot' AND Department = 'Technology' ORDER BY Name
